This is the classic helicopter game. You try to dodge the floor, ceiling and obstacles to fly forward as far as you can go. The intention of this project was to create a game where the number of dimensions was a mechanic, sort of like super paper mario or fez. However, I didn't get very far. I learned a lot, so please enjoy. 

Like my other games, C++, SFML, made by me, Jeffrey Maurer, 1/20/2017 on VS 2013.

I learned how to use sprites, sound, create high scores and various other things. I especially learned a lot trying to generate the floors and ceiling procedurally.

If you want to play with more dimensions, uncomment code in the game object for input and for the obstacles themselves.

Press space to start, S for down, W for up and gravity will always be there for you. Don't touch anything and enjoy the ride.
