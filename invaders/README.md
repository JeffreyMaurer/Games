This program was written by me, Jeffrey Maurer, on 12/26/2016. I wrote it in C++ with the 2013 version of Visual Studio and using the SFML graphics library.

To play, you need to set up the environment correctly, compile and run. Pressing up starts each level, spacebar shoots and the left/right arrows move you in those directions. Be careful, if the aliens make it down, you lose. If you touch them or get hit, you lose a life.
